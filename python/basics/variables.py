# Declaring a variable in Python is very easy, we do not really need to declare its data type before naming it
# Unlike in othe programming languages like C, C++, and Java, where we declare a data type for each variable. 
# In Python, we simply assign a value into a variable, and the interpreter knows what type it is.  

# Common Data Types 
# Integer, Long, Float, Double, Boolean, String, Character

# Declaring a variable of numeric types 
num_int = 1 
print(num_int)

num_float = 1.50 
print(num_float)

# Declaring a variable of String 
message = "Hello, World!"
print(message)

# Declaring a variable of character 
# NOTE: Characters contain only one literal character value
character = 'E'
print(character)
