# Operators are symbols responsible for computing operations and tasks like addition, multiplication, subraction, division, 
# and exponentiations. Moreover, there are in-built functions that can perform rigourous and long computations with the help of 
# imported libraries. 
# 
# In Python just like other programming languages we have +, -, *, /, and **. All of which are responsble for 
# addition, subtraction, multiplication,division, and exponentiation respectively.
# Lastly, these said operators are for arithmetic operations that can produce a numerical result. 


# On the other hand, we also have comparison operators which are used for comparing values and expressions. 
# These operators include <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=. 
# All of  which corresponds to less than to, greater than to, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to, 
# is equal to, and not equal to respectively. 
# These operators may result to boolean outputs, as such these are used for conditional values when we try to compare
# expressions, values, and statements.

# From the book: 
#   Operators are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication. 
#   The values the operator is applied to are called operands

# ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
# ____________________________
# Using the addition operator, + 
a = 10 
b = 11 
c = a + b          # the variables a and b here are called operands with the addition operation 
print(c)

# Using the subtraction operator, - 
d = b - c
print(d)

# Using the multiplication operator, * 
e = a * b  
print(e) 

# Using the division operator, / 
num1 = 64 
num2 = 2
num_result = num1 / num2
print(num_result)

# Using the exponentiation operator, ** 
# NOTE: a ** b, where a is the base and b is the power 
#       so, a to the power of b 
exp_n = 2 ** 3 
print(exp_n) 

exp_n = exp_n * (c + d + e + num_result)
print(exp_n)
