# In this journey, I will go again from basics to indermediate up to advanced. I am pretty much familiar with Python language
# But I thought that I can create this project so that I can rehone my current skills to mastery. 
# So far, I encountered Python with programming assignments and problems as well as using it for Data Science particularly 
# NumPy, Pandas, Scilearn kit, and more into creating and training Models.
# 
# 
# I want to learn and understand more because I know I can do it, and I am confident that I can do so.

# Python is a programming language used in mamy ways one of which is creating programs, applications, and scripts to 
# run or build tasks
# 
# With Python we can create GUI by using their modules built for that. Moreover, we can also create programs to create and 
# insert values to databases.  
#
# There are many more things we can do with Python just like with other programming languages. It is up to us to utilize all 
# of Python's resources and modules to suit our needs
